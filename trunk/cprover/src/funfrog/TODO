TODO list for funfrog
=====================

HIGH PRIORITY
-------------

- Mapping for global variables, refactor:
  - unify accessed globals and arguments
  - unify modified globals and return value (the extra temp. variable is probably not needed - check it!).
- Integration with loop handling tool
  - CBMC: basically, we only need
- UFLIA encoding
  - choose solver, create wrapper, interpolant back propagation
- Bit-vectors encoding
  - examine wolverine's interpolation engine
- Merge deferred_functiont & partitiont <-- too close concepts


LOW PRIORITY
------------

- symex_assertion_sum.cpp: Leave the choice of the concrete assertion for later (we might want to generate the SSA form only once and then use it for a number of checks)
  - Maybe we could use the already generated SSA parts while refining certain callsites (and not generate it again and again..., OpenSMT in interactive mode?)
- Aliasing
- Slicing (does not work due to deferring of functions and partitioning = reordering of SSA steps)
- Error trace fixing

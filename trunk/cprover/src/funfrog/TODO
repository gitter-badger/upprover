TODO list for funfrog
=====================

HIGH PRIORITY
-------------

- Interactive mode of:
  - SSA generation - share one instance throughout check_claims
  - OpenSMT session - share one instance during checking of a single assertion
  - this may require a major redesign... (especially the crappy "*_info" classes and storage of the deferred functions & partitions)
- When checking multiple instances of the same assertion, forced inlining works only for the first instance (its call stack)
- Summaries are generated again and again for functions that are on the assertion call stacks (what is their semantics anyway?)


LOW PRIORITY
------------

- Merge deferred_functiont & partitiont <-- too close concepts
- Mapping for global variables, refactor:
  - unify accessed globals and arguments
  - unify modified globals and return value (the extra temp. variable is probably not needed - check it!).
- Aliasing
- UFLIA encoding
  - choose solver, create wrapper, interpolant back propagation
- Bit-vectors encoding
  - examine wolverine's interpolation engine


IDEAS
-----

- record variables really constrained and referred to in each summary, this should help in choosing
the right summary as well as making slicing more efficient.


BUGS
----

- Too many symbols in the renaming tables (remove locals and the special call start and call end symbols)
- Slicing can remove "unrelated" assumptions that, however, make an error reaching trace unfeasible (thus reporting a nonexistent error).
- Error trace computation is broken - segfault on trace computation (not addapted to partitioning symex target yet)

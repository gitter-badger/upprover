TODO list for funfrog
=====================

HIGH PRIORITY
-------------

- (sort of done) Refinement has several flaws - marked by FIXME in refiner_assertion_sum.cpp

LOW PRIORITY
------------

- Interactive mode of:
  - OpenSMT session - share one instance during checking of a single assertion
- Mapping for global variables, refactor:
  - unify accessed globals and arguments
  - unify modified globals and return value (the extra temp. variable is probably not needed - check it!).
- Aliasing
- UFLIA encoding
  - choose solver, create wrapper, interpolant back propagation
- Bit-vectors encoding
  - examine wolverine's interpolation engine


BUGS
----

- Not all accesses to global variables are detected in function_info.cpp (set DEBUG_GLOBALS on McMillan's examples!)
- Too many symbols in the renaming tables (remove locals and the special call start and call end symbols)
- Slicing can remove "unrelated" assumptions that, however, make an error reaching trace unfeasible (thus reporting a nonexistent error).
- Error trace computation is broken - segfault on trace computation (not addapted to partitioning symex target yet)
- Unsufficient loop unwinding (k times, if there are loops with n>k iterations) leads to "assertion is trivially unreachable" if the assertion is in the same function, or to SAT if the loop is separated to different function.
- "--unwind n" in fact unwinds (n-1) times. The bug came from cbmc..

BUGGY TEST CASES:
----------------
13_upg_simple_holds/change11.c : trivial case, consists just only of 1 function main and assertions inside. the changes are minimal, and it's expected, that the summary will be valid... but:

XXX Partition: 1 (ass_in_subtree: 1) - c::main (loc: 8, INV)
    vars: 3
    clauses: 1
    vars in subtree: 3
    clauses in subtree: 1
XXX Partition: 0 (ass_in_subtree: 1) - c::main (loc: 8, INL)
warning: ignoring symbol
  * type: empty

        * line: 1
  * identifier: funfrog::c::main::\retval_tmp#0
    vars: 0
    clauses: 0
    vars in subtree: 0
    clauses in subtree: 0
CONVERSION TIME: 0

... which leads to SAT again.

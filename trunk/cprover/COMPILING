What architecture?
------------------

CPROVER compiles with in the following environments:
- Linux
- MacOS X
- Cygwin (using -mno-cygwin)
- Microsoft's Visual Studio 2008

You need to adjust config.inc to reflect the environment. The default is
Linux.


How to compile?
---------------

Follow these instructions:

1) You need a SAT solver (in source). We recommend MiniSat2.
   Note that you must use simp/Makefile to build MiniSat2.

   Alternatively, you may use zchaff, Booleforce, or
   SMV-SAT (if you work for Cadence).

2) Adjust src/config.inc for the paths to a).

3) Adjust src/solvers/satcheck.h to select which SAT solver to use
   as the default.

4) Adjust the file src/utils/hash_cont.h

   Depending on the version of your STL, you need to adjust a preprocessor
   command. Recent versions of Linux and Cygwin run with the defaults.

   For Microsoft's Visual Studio, get
   http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb982198.aspx
   and use TR1_HASH_CONT

5) Type cd src; make - that should do it.

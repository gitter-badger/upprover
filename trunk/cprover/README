COMPILATION
-----------

For compilation, you need an aditional package:

a) Zchaff (a SAT checker), available from Princeton at

   http://www.ee.princeton.edu/~chaff/zchaff.php

b) Alternatively, use Minisat or Booleforce

For compilation, you need a recent g++ compiler and the usual parser/lexer
tools.

USAGE
-----

After compilation, there are six binaries in corresponding subdirectories:

1) abs

   This is a tool for the abstraction of ANSI-C programs

2) b2cnf

   This is a translator from SMV language to CNF

3) c2pvs

   A translator from C to PVS language

4) ebmc

   This is an enhanced version of BMC, using a sorting network for the
   diameter test

5) cbmc

   This is the Bounded Model Checker for ANSI-C. cbmc is a command line
   tool. You pass the name of the input files as parameters.

6) cprover

   This is the theorem prover. The theorem prover interfaces with SyMP, so
   to use it, you need to get Sergey Berezin's SyMP from the CMU
   Model-Checking homepage.

All tools are likely to have bugs and missing features. Let me know if you
find anything of that sort and I will fix it as soon as possible. We are
always looking for interesting applications and challenge examples. If you
have one, we would love to try to solve it.
